# Urban-food

*Overview:*

Foodify is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to mimic the functionalities of iFood, a popular food delivery service. This application aims to facilitate users in exploring restaurants, browsing menus, and ordering food online with ease. It features an intuitive user interface for both customers and vendors, backed by a robust backend to handle operations efficiently.

*Technologies Used:*

Frontend:
React: Utilized for building the user interface with reusable components.
Next.js: A framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites with React, improving performance and SEO.
TypeScript: Employed for adding static type definitions to enhance code quality and readability.
Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the application with a utility-first approach, allowing rapid UI development.
Shadcn: Although less common, this technology will be used for creating dynamic shadow DOM components, ensuring encapsulated styling and enhanced UI component reusability.
Backend:
Prisma: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interface with the database seamlessly using strong typing benefits of TypeScript.
PostgreSQL: Chosen as the relational database to store data including user profiles, restaurant details, orders, etc., due to its robustness and reliability.
Next.js API Routes: To handle API requests such as fetching restaurant data, processing orders, and managing user sessions.
